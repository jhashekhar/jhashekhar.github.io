<p>
After reading and doing some toy projects in deep learning I got interested in various aspects of non-convex optimization,
expressiveness of deep neural nets, generalization to name a few. <!--more-->In this post I would be listing down some of the questions that came to my mind while studying and doing problems in no specific order.</p>

<ul style="font-size: 15px;">
<li>Why gradient descent works ?</li>
<li>How does depth of neural network helps ?</li>
<li>Can a very large width network have same function approximation power as a significantly deeper network ?</li>
<li>What ensures generalization of empirical hypotheses ?</li>
<li>Depth improves expressiveness but complicates optimization - Why and How ?</li>
</ul>
